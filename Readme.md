# SHM-SUPER HISTORY MACHINE
Time-machine written in COBOL.<br>
Works both on the IDE and compiled.<br>
It will cover all the XX century.<br>
There are 10 years now (1900-1910) but I'll add more years every day<br>
I added a feature that says "You want to see events from other years?" and let you restart the program.<br>
Attention! To run them you need the OpenCobolIDE dlls<br>
You can use my code for inspiration:)
