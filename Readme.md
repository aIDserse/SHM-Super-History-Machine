Time-machine written in COBOL.
Works both on the IDE and compiled.
It will cover all the XX century.
There are 10 years now (1900-1910) but I'll add more years every day
I added a feature that says "You want to see events from other years?" and let you restart the program.
You can use my code for inspiration:)
